            together to build, distribute, and

            interact
            with Docker. It sends commands (such as build, pull, run, push) to the Docker Daemon using the Docker
            API.<br /><strong>2 - Docker Host</strong><br /> This is where the Docker Daemon runs. It manages images,
            containers, networks, and volumes, and is responsible for building and running applications.<br /><strong>3
              - Docker
              Registry</strong><br /> The storage system for Docker images. Public registries like Docker Hub or private

            can also
            be saved to an Event Store. Events are emitted to update the Read Model asynchronously.<br /> 3 - The
            projections
            are stored in the Read Database. This database is eventually consistent with the Write Database.<br /> 4 -
            On the
            query side, the client sends a query to retrieve data.<br /> 5 - A Query Handler fetches data from the Read
            Database, which contains precomputed projections.<br /> 6 - Results are returned to the client without
            hitting the

          <p class="p-white"> &ldquo;Build once, run anywhere.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the promise of containerization, and
            here&rsquo;s how it
            actually works:<br /> Build Flow: Everything starts with a Dockerfile, which defines how your app should be
            built.
            When you run docker build, it creates a Docker Image containing:<br /> - Your code<br /> - The required
            dependencies<br /> - Necessary libraries<br /> This image is portable. You can move it across environments,
            and
            it&rsquo;ll behave the same way, whether on your local machine, a CI server, or in the cloud.<br /> Runtime
            Architecture: When you run the image, it becomes a Container, an isolated environment that executes the
            application.
            Multiple containers can run on the same host, each with its own filesystem, process space, and network
            stack.<br /> The Container Engine (like Docker, containerd, CRI-O, or Podman) manages:<br /> - The
            container
            lifecycle<br /> - Networking and isolation<br /> - Resource allocation<br /> All containers share the
            Host OS
            kernel, sitting on top of the hardware. That&rsquo;s how containerization achieves both consistency and
            efficiency,
            light like processes, but isolated like VMs.</p>

        <div class="arch-info-white">
          <p class="p-white"> Your API is slow. But how slow, exactly? You need numbers. Real metrics that tell you
            what's actually broken and
            where to fix it. <br /> Here are the four core metrics every engineer should know when analyzing
            system
            performance:<br /> - Queries Per Second (QPS): How many incoming requests your system handles per
            second. Your
            server gets 1,000 requests in one second? That's 1,000 QPS. Sounds straightforward until you realize most
            systems
            can't sustain their peak QPS for long without things starting to break.<br /> - Transactions Per
            Second (TPS):
            How many completed transactions your system processes per second. A transaction includes the full round
            trip, i.e.,
            the request goes out, hits the database, and comes back with a response.<br /> TPS tells you about actual
            work
            completed, not just requests received. This is what your business cares about.<br /> - Concurrency: How many
            simultaneous active requests your system is handling at any given moment. You could have 100 requests per
            second,
            but if each takes 5 seconds to complete, you're actually handling 500 concurrent requests at once. <br />
            High
            concurrency means you need more resources, better connection pooling, and smarter thread management.<br /> -
            Response Time (RT): The elapsed time from when a request starts until the response is received. Measured at
            both the
            client level and server level.<br /> A simple relationship ties them all together: QPS = Concurrency
            &divide;
            Average Response Time<br /> More concurrency or lower response time = higher throughput.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="arch-info-white">
          <p class="p-white"> Basic Authentication: Clients include a Base64-encoded username and password in
            every request header, which is simple
            but insecure since credentials are transmitted in plaintext. Useful in quick prototypes or internal
            services over
            secure networks.<br /> 2. Session Authentication: After login, the server creates a session record and
            issues a
            cookie. Subsequent requests send that cookie so the server can validate user state. Used in
            traditional
            web-apps.<br /> 3. Token Authentication: Clients authenticate once to receive a signed token, then
            present the token
            on each request for stateless authentication. Used in single-page applications and modern APIs that
            require
            scalable, stateless authentication.<br /> 4. OAuth-Based Authentication: Clients obtain an access
            token via an
            authorization grant from an OAuth provider, then use that token to call resource servers on the
            user&rsquo;s behalf.
            Used in cases of third-party integrations or apps that need delegated access to user data.<br /> 5.
            API Key
            Authentication: Clients present a predefined key (often in headers or query strings) with each
            request. The server
            verifies the key to authorize access. Used in service-to-service or machine-to-machine APIs where
            simple credential
            checks are sufficient.</p>

        <div class="arch-info-white">
          <p class="p-white"> Before containers simplified deployment, virtualization changed how we used
            hardware. Both isolate workloads, but
            they do it differently.<br /> - Virtualization (Hardware-level isolation): Each virtual machine
            runs a
            complete operating system, Windows, Fedora, or Ubuntu, with its own kernel, drivers, and libraries.
            The hypervisor
            (VMware ESXi, Hyper-V, KVM) sits directly on hardware and emulates physical machines for each guest
            OS. <br /> This
            makes VMs heavy but isolated. Need Windows and Linux on the same box? VMs handle it easily. Startup
            time for a
            typical VM is in minutes because you're booting an entire operating system from scratch.<br /> -
            Containerization
            (OS-level isolation): Containers share the host operating system's kernel. No separate OS per
            container. Just
            isolated processes with their own filesystem and dependencies.<br /> The container engine
            (Docker, containerd,
            CRI-O, Podman) manages lifecycle, networking, and isolation, but it all runs on top of a single shared
            kernel.
            Lightweight and fast. Containers start in milliseconds because you're not booting an OS, just
            launching a
            process.<br /> But here's the catch: all containers on a host must be compatible with that host's
            kernel. Can't run
            Windows containers on a Linux host (without nested virtualization tricks).</p>

          <p class="p-white"> Virtualization didn&rsquo;t just make servers efficient, it changed how we build,
            scale, and deploy everything.
            Here&rsquo;s a quick breakdown of the four major types of virtualization you&rsquo;ll find in modern
            systems:<br />
            1. Traditional (Bare Metal): Applications run directly on the operating system. No virtualization
            layer, no
            isolation between processes. All applications share the same OS kernel, libraries, and
            resources.<br /> 2.
            Virtualized (VM-based): Each VM runs its own complete operating system. The hypervisor sits on
            physical hardware and
            emulates entire machines for each guest OS. Each VM thinks it has dedicated hardware even though it's
            sharing the
            same physical server.<br /> 3. Containerized: Containers share the host operating system's kernel but
            get isolated
            runtime environments. Each container has its own filesystem, but they're all using the same underlying
            OS. The
            container engine (Docker, containerd, Podman) manages lifecycle, networking, and isolation without
            needing separate
            operating systems for each application.<br /> Lightweight and fast. Containers start in milliseconds
            because you're
            not booting an OS. Resource usage is dramatically lower than VMs.<br /> 4. Containers on VMs: This is
            what actually
            runs in production cloud environments. Containers inside VMs, getting benefits from both. Each VM runs
            its own guest
            OS with a container engine inside. The hypervisor provides hardware-level isolation between VMs. The
            container
            engine provides lightweight application isolation within VMs.<br /> This is the architecture
            behind Kubernetes
            clusters on AWS, Azure, and GCP. Your pods are containers, but they're running inside VMs you never
            directly see or
            manage.</p>

            work. <br />
            𝐆𝐢𝐭 𝐌𝐞𝐫𝐠𝐞 <br /> This creates a new commit G&rsquo; in the main branch. G&rsquo; ties the
            histories of both
            main and feature branches. <br /> Git merge is 𝐧𝐨𝐧-𝐝𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞. Neither the main nor the
            feature
            branch is changed. <br /> 𝐆𝐢𝐭 𝐑𝐞𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞 <br /> Git rebase moves the feature branch
            histories to the head
            of the main branch. It creates new commits E&rsquo;, F&rsquo;, and G&rsquo; for each commit in the
            feature branch.
            <br /> The benefit of rebase is that it has 𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐚𝐫 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐢𝐭 𝐡𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐲. <br /> Rebase

        <div class="arch-info-white">
          <p class="p-white"> A well-designed API feels invisible, it just works. Behind that
            simplicity lies a set of consistent design principles
            that make APIs predictable, secure, and scalable.<br /> Here's what separates good
            APIs from terrible
            ones:<br /> - Idempotency: GET, HEAD, PUT, and DELETE should be idempotent. Send the same
            request twice, get the
            same result. No unintended side effects. POST and PATCH are not idempotent. Each call
            creates a new resource or
            modifies the state differently.<br /> Use idempotency keys stored in Redis or your
            database. Client sends the same
            key with retries, server recognizes it and returns the original response instead of
            processing again.<br /> -
            Versioning<br /> - Noun-based resource names: Resources should be nouns, not verbs.
            &ldquo;/api/products&rdquo;, not
            &ldquo;/api/getProducts&rdquo;.<br /> - Security: Secure every endpoint with proper
            authentication. Bearer tokens
            (like JWTs) include a header, payload, and signature to validate requests. Always use
            HTTPS and verify tokens on
            every call.<br /> - Pagination: When returning large datasets, use pagination parameters
            like
            &ldquo;?limit=10&amp;offset=20&rdquo; to keep responses efficient and consistent.</p>

          <p class="p-white"> Result Pagination: <br /> This method is used to optimize large result
            sets by streaming them back to the client,
            enhancing service responsiveness and user experience.<br /> Asynchronous Logging: <br />
            This approach involves
            sending logs to a lock-free buffer and returning immediately, rather than dealing with the
            disk on every call. Logs
            are periodically flushed to the disk, significantly reducing I/O overhead.<br /> Data
            Caching: <br /> Frequently
            accessed data can be stored in a cache to speed up retrieval. Clients check the cache
            before querying the database,
            with data storage solutions like Redis offering faster access due to in-memory
            storage.<br /> Payload Compression:
            <br /> To reduce data transmission time, requests and responses can be compressed (e.g.,
            using gzip), making the
            upload and download processes quicker.<br /> Connection Pooling: <br /> This technique
            involves using a pool of open
            connections to manage database interaction, which reduces the overhead associated with
            opening and closing
            connections each time data needs to be loaded. The pool manages the lifecycle of
            connections for efficient resource
            use.

          <p class="p-white"> This is done after API development is complete. Simply validate if the
            APIs are working and nothing breaks. <br /> 🔹
            Functional Testing <br /> This creates a test plan based on the functional requirements
            and compares the results
            with the expected results. <br /> 🔹 Integration Testing <br /> This test combines several
            API calls to perform
            end-to-end tests. The intra-service communications and data transmissions are tested.
            <br /> 🔹 Regression Testing
            <br /> This test ensures that bug fixes or new features shouldn&rsquo;t break the existing
            behaviors of APIs. <br />
            🔹 Load Testing <br /> This tests applications&rsquo; performance by simulating different
            loads. Then we can
            calculate the capacity of the application. <br /> 🔹 Stress Testing <br /> We deliberately
            create high loads to the
            APIs and test if the APIs are able to function normally. <br /> 🔹 Security Testing <br />
            This tests the APIs
            against all possible external threats. <br /> 🔹 UI Testing <br /> This tests the UI
            interactions with the APIs to
            make sure the data can be displayed properly. <br /> 🔹 Fuzz Testing <br /> This injects
            invalid or unexpected input
            data into the API and tries to crash the API. In this way, it identifies the API
            vulnerabilities.

          <p class="p-white"> Your API is slow. Users are complaining. And you have no idea
            where to start looking. Here is the systematic approach
            to track down what is killing your API.<br /> Start with the network: High
            latency? Throw a CDN in front of
            your static assets. Large payloads? Compress your responses. These are quick wins
            that don't require touching
            code.<br /> Check your backend code next: This is where most slowdowns hide.
            CPU-heavy operations should run in the
            background. Complicated business logic that needs simplification. Blocking
            synchronous calls that should be async.
            Profile it, find the hot paths, fix them.<br /> Check the database: Missing indexes
            are the classic culprit. Also
            watch for N+1 queries, where you are hammering the database hundreds of times when
            one batch query would do.<br />
            Don't forget external APIs: That Stripe call, that Google Maps request, they are
            outside your control. Make parallel
            calls where you can. Set aggressive timeouts and retries so one slow third-party
            doesn't tank your whole
            response.<br /> Finally, check your infrastructure: Maxed-out servers need
            auto-scaling. Connection pool limits need
            tuning. Sometimes the problem isn't your code at all, it&rsquo;s that you are trying
            to serve 10,000 requests with
            resources built for 100.<br /> The key is being methodical. Don't just throw
            solutions at the wall. Measure
            first, identify the actual bottleneck, then fix it.</p>

      <p>&#127919;</span><span>Goal</p>

      <p>&#128313;</span><span>How It Works</p>
      <p>Test Start</p>
      <p> Start SQL Container</p>
      <p> Run Migrations</p>
      <p> Call API</p>
      <p> Verify DB</p>
      <p> Destroy Container</p>

      <p>&#128313;</span><span>Example (.NET + SQL Server)</p>
      <p>public class OrderApiTests : IAsyncLifetime</p>
      <p>{</p>
      <p> private readonly MsSqlContainer _db =</p>
      <p> new MsSqlBuilder().Build();</p>
      <p> public async Task InitializeAsync()</p>
      <p> {</p>
      <p> await _db.StartAsync();</p>
      <p> }</p>
      <p> public async Task DisposeAsync()</p>
      <p> {</p>
      <p> await _db.DisposeAsync();</p>
      <p> }</p>
      <p> [Fact]</p>
      <p> public async Task CreateOrder_ShouldPersistData()</p>
      <p> {</p>
      <p> // Arrange</p>
      <p> var client = new HttpClient();</p>
      <p> // Act</p>
      <p> var response = await client.PostAsJsonAsync(</p>
      <p> &quot;/orders&quot;, new { ProductId = 1,
        Quantity = 2 });</p>
      <p> // Assert</p>
      <p> response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();</p>
      <p> }</p>
      <p>}</p>

      <p>&#127919;</span><span>Objective</p>
      <p>Validate that your system </span><span>remains reliable when things
          fail</span><span>(because failures </span><span>will</span><span>happen).</p>

      <p>&#128313;</span><span>Step 1: Define Steady State</p>
      <p>Decide what &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; means:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Error rate &lt; 1%</li>
        <li>p95 latency &lt; 300 ms</li>
        <li>No data loss</li>
      </ul>
      <p>&#128204;</span><span>This is your </span><span>baseline</span><span>.</p>

      <p>&#128313;</span><span>Step 2: Choose Failure Scenario</p>
      <p>Common chaos experiments:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Kill random pods</li>
        <li>Inject network latency</li>
        <li>Block database access</li>
        <li>Simulate node failure</li>
      </ul>

      <p>&#128313;</span><span>Step 3: Inject Fault</p>
      <p>Normal Traffic</p>
      <p> Chaos Tool Injects Failure</p>
      <p> System Under Stress</p>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Kill 30% of Order Service pods</li>
      </ul>

      <p>&#128313;</span><span>Step 4: Observe &amp; Measure</p>
      <p>Watch:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Auto-scaling</li>
        <li>Retries &amp; circuit breakers</li>
        <li>Alert firing</li>
