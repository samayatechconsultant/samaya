                                                    <p> Build Flow: Everything starts with a Dockerfile, which defines

                                                        your app
                                                        should be built. When you run docker build, it creates a Docker

                                                    <p> Basic Authentication: Clients include a Base64-encoded username

                                                        signed token,
                                                        then present the token on each request for stateless

                                                        Used in
                                                        single-page applications and modern APIs that require scalable,

                                                    <p> 4. OAuth-Based Authentication: Clients obtain an access token
                                                        via an
                                                        authorization grant from an OAuth provider, then use that token
                                                        to
                                                        call resource
                                                        servers on the user&rsquo;s behalf. Used in cases of third-party
                                                        integrations or
                                                        apps that need delegated access to user data.</p>
                                                    <p> 5. API Key Authentication: Clients present a predefined key
                                                        (often
                                                        in headers or
                                                        query strings) with each request. The server verifies the key to
                                                        authorize
                                                        access. Used in service-to-service or machine-to-machine APIs
                                                        where
                                                        simple
                                                        credential checks are sufficient. </p>

                                                        how
                                                        we used
                                                        hardware. Both isolate workloads, but they do it differently.

                                                        handle it easily. Startup time for a typical VM is in minutes

                                                    <p> - Containerization (OS-level isolation): Containers share the

                                                        processes with their

                                                    <p> The container engine (Docker, containerd, CRI-O, Podman) manages

                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> 1. Traditional (Bare Metal): Applications run directly on the
                                                        operating system.
                                                        No virtualization layer, no isolation between processes. All
                                                        applications share
                                                        the same OS kernel, libraries, and resources.</p>
                                                    <p> 2. Virtualized (VM-based): Each VM runs its own complete
                                                        operating
                                                        system. The
                                                        hypervisor sits on physical hardware and emulates entire
                                                        machines
                                                        for each guest
                                                        OS. Each VM thinks it has dedicated hardware even though it's
                                                        sharing the same
                                                        physical server.</p>
                                                    <p> 3. Containerized: Containers share the host operating system's
                                                        kernel but get
                                                        isolated runtime environments. Each container has its own
                                                        filesystem, but they're
                                                        all using the same underlying OS. The container engine (Docker,
                                                        containerd,
                                                        Podman) manages lifecycle, networking, and isolation without
                                                        needing
                                                        separate
                                                        operating systems for each application. </p>
                                                    <p> Lightweight and fast. Containers start in milliseconds because
                                                        you're not
                                                        booting an OS. Resource usage is dramatically lower than VMs.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> 4. Containers on VMs: This is what actually runs in production
                                                        cloud
                                                        environments. Containers inside VMs, getting benefits from both.
                                                        Each VM runs its
                                                        own guest OS with a container engine inside. The hypervisor
                                                        provides
                                                        hardware-level isolation between VMs. The container engine
                                                        provides
                                                        lightweight
                                                        application isolation within VMs.</p>

                                                    <p> A well-designed API feels invisible, it just works. Behind that
                                                        simplicity lies
                                                        a set of consistent design principles that make APIs
                                                        predictable,
                                                        secure, and
                                                        scalable. </p>

                                                    <p> - Idempotency: GET, HEAD, PUT, and DELETE should be idempotent.
                                                        Send

                                                        and PATCH
                                                        are not idempotent. Each call creates a new resource or modifies
                                                        the

                                                    <p> Use idempotency keys stored in Redis or your database. Client

                                                    <p> This approach involves sending logs to a lock-free buffer and

                                                        periodically flushed to the disk, significantly reducing I/O

                                                    <p> Frequently accessed data can be stored in a cache to speed up
                                                        retrieval. Clients
                                                        check the cache before querying the database, with data storage
                                                        solutions like
                                                        Redis offering faster access due to in-memory storage.</p>

                                                    <p> To reduce data transmission time, requests and responses can be
                                                        compressed
                                                        (e.g., using gzip), making the upload and download processes
                                                        quicker.</p>
                                                    <p> Connection Pooling: </p>
                                                    <p> This technique involves using a pool of open connections to

                                                        database
                                                        interaction, which reduces the overhead associated with opening
                                                        and
                                                        closing
                                                        connections each time data needs to be loaded. The pool manages
                                                        the
                                                        lifecycle of

                                                    <p> Your API is slow. Users are complaining. And you have no idea
                                                        where
                                                        to start
                                                        looking. Here is the systematic approach to track down what is
                                                        killing your API.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p> Start with the network: High latency? Throw a CDN in front of
                                                        your
                                                        static
                                                        assets. Large payloads? Compress your responses. These are quick
                                                        wins that don't
                                                        require touching code. </p>
                                                    <p> Check your backend code next: This is where most slowdowns hide.
                                                        CPU-heavy
                                                        operations should run in the background. Complicated business
                                                        logic
                                                        that needs
                                                        simplification. Blocking synchronous calls that should be async.
                                                        Profile it, find
                                                        the hot paths, fix them. </p>
                                                    <p> Check the database: Missing indexes are the classic culprit.
                                                        Also
                                                        watch for N+1
                                                        queries, where you are hammering the database hundreds of times
                                                        when
                                                        one batch
                                                        query would do.</p>
                                                    <p> Don't forget external APIs: That Stripe call, that Google Maps
                                                        request, they are
                                                        outside your control. Make parallel calls where you can. Set
                                                        aggressive timeouts
                                                        and retries so one slow third-party doesn't tank your whole
                                                        response.</p>
                                                    <p> Finally, check your infrastructure: Maxed-out servers need
                                                        auto-scaling.
                                                        Connection pool limits need tuning. Sometimes the problem isn't

                                                    <p> The key is being methodical. Don't just throw solutions at the
                                                        wall.
                                                        Measure
                                                        first, identify the actual bottleneck, then fix it.</p>
