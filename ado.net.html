                     <p>#_Test Automation involves the use of special software (separate from the software being tested)
                        to control the execution of tests and the comparison of actual outcomes with predicted outcomes.
                        Automated testing can extend the depth and scope of tests to help improve software quality.</p>
                     <p>#_It involves automating a manual process necessary for the testing phase of the software
                        development lifecycle. These tests can include functionality testing, performance testing,
                        regression testing, and more. </p>
                     <p>#_The goal of test automation is to increase efficiency, effectiveness, and coverage of software
                        testing with the least amount of human intervention. It allows for the repeated running of these
                        tests, which would be otherwise difficult to perform manually. </p>
                     <p>#_Test automation is a critical part of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
                        practices, as it enables frequent and consistent testing to catch issues as early as possible.

                     <p>#_ A discipline that incorporates aspects of software engineering and applies them to
                        infrastructure and operations problems. The main goals are to create scalable and highly
                        reliable software systems. SRE is a role that was originated at Google to bridge the gap between
                        development and operations by applying a software engineering mindset to system administration
                        topics. SREs use software as a tool to manage systems, solve problems, and automate operations
                        tasks.</p>
                     <p>#_ The core principle of SRE is to treat operations as if it's a software problem. They define a
                        set of work that includes automation, continuous integration/delivery, ensuring reliability and
                        uptime, and enforcing</p>
                     <p>performance. They work closely with product teams to advise on the operability of systems,
                        ensure they are prepared for new releases and can scale to the demands of the business.</p>

                     <p>A decentralized computing infrastructure in which data, compute, storage, and applications are
                        distributed in the most logical, efficient place between the data source and the cloud.</p>
                     <p>⛓ Blockchain</p>
                     <p>#_ Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger technology that maintains a growing list of
                        records, called blocks, that are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic
                        hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data.</p>
                     <p>#_ The design of a blockchain is inherently resistant to data modification. Once recorded, the
                        data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent
                        blocks. This makes blockchain technology suitable for the recording of events, medical records,
                        identity management, transaction processing, and documenting provenance, among other things.</p>
