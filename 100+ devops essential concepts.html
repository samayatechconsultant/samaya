                            scalable and highly reliable software systems. SRE is a role that was originated at Google
                            to bridge the gap between development and operations by applying a software engineering
                            mindset to system administration topics. SREs use software as a tool to manage systems,
                            solve problems, and automate operations tasks. #_ The core principle of SRE is to treat
                            operations as if it's a software problem. They define a set of work that includes
                            automation, continuous integration/delivery, ensuring reliability and uptime, and enforcing
                            performance. They work closely with product teams to advise on the operability of systems,
                            ensure they are prepared for new releases and can scale to the demands of the business.

                            a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked using cryptography. Each block
                            contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. #_
                            The design of a blockchain is inherently resistant to data modification. Once recorded, the
                            data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent
                            blocks. This makes blockchain technology suitable for the recording of events, medical
                            records, identity management, transaction processing, and documenting provenance, among
                            other things. </div>
